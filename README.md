# Jasmin language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Jasmin files in Atom.

Originally converted from the [Atom language-C package](https://github.com/atom/language-c).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.

## Installation

Because this language is not available through the package manager it needs to be installed manually:

    cd ~/.atom/packages/
    git clone git git@github.com:ildyria/language-jasmin.git
